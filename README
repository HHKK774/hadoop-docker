# please run "docker build -t eg_sshd" to build the eg_sshd image first
# then run "docker run -d -P --name test_sshd eg_sshd"
# i don't integrate it into the script because it doesn't have to be run repeatedly

# since the image "hadoop-docker" cannot be pushed to docker hub now, i save it to local
# and you should load the image x(in this package)x by running "docker load --input hadoop-docker.tar" (you can ask me for the file if needed)
# you can also tag the image and push it to your docker hub if you can

# the master node would not start resource-manager and node-manager automatically
# we can exec into the bash of master node then run start-all. it's the same because at last we have to run mapreduce on it
